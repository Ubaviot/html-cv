    <h1>My hobbies</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I’m a person with diverse interests and experiences that shape who I am.
      <br />
      I enjoy playing football, which keeps me active, disciplined, and
      connected with teamwork and competition. <br />
      Music is also a big part of my life — I’m a drummer, and through drumming
      I’ve learned creativity, rhythm, and persistence. <br />
      Professionally, I currently work as a dispatcher, where I focus on
      organization, problem-solving, and communication. In the past, I also
      worked as a waiter, an experience that strengthened my patience,
      adaptability, and people skills in fast-paced environments. <br />
      On top of that, I’ve recently started learning coding, which I see as an
      exciting challenge and a chance to expand my career opportunities in the
      future. <br />
